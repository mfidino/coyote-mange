<div align="center"> <h3>./im_calls/</h3> </div>

---

This folder just contains one script, titled `figure_3_calls.txt`. I used imagemagick to combine the two subplots for figure 2 and add in the a) and b) symbols. These are just the notes I took in a text file so I could remember what to call from the console.

<div align="center"> <h3>./jags_script/</h3> </div>

---

This folder contains three JAGS scripts, all of which are different parameterizations of the model we developed in the manuscript.

**`./jags_script/conditional_model.R`**: This is  the multi-season model without an autologistic term (i.e., assumes samples are independent among seasons).

**`./jags_script/conditional_model_autologistic.R`**: The is the multi-season model with an autologistic term, and the one we fit to our coyote data. All of the scripts (e.g., plotting) assume this is the model that is fit.

**`./jags_script/conditional_model_single_season.R`**: This isthe single season model we used for our simulated example.

<div align="center"> <h3>./plots/</h3> </div>

Contains plots 3, 4, and 5 of the manuscript, as well as the model evaluation plots for the supplemental material (within it's own subfolder).

<div align="center"> <h3>./python/</h3> </div>

Contains a single script, `blur_detection.py`, which is what we used to calculate the blur metric for all of the coyote images in our analysis.

<div align="center"><img width="150" height="auto" align="center" src="./assets/coyote.png" alt="A line drawing of a coyote." /></div>

<div align="center"> <h3>./R/</h3> </div>

---

Contains the seven R scripts for this analysis.  If you were to run them in order they would go.

**`./R/prep_data.R`**: A script that prepares all of the coyote data for analysis.

**`./R/fit_conditional_mange_model.R`**: This fits the autologistic conditional mange model.

**`./R/evaluate_mange_model.R`**: This calculates some model diagnostics.

**`./R/summarize_conditional_mange_model.R`**: This summarizes the model and plots out some of the results.

**`./R/mange_map.R`**: This plots out the distribution of coyote, mangy or otherwise, and mangy coyote throughout Chicago, based on our model.

**`./R/model_simulation_example.Rmd`**: A markdown file that generates one of the supplemental files, which walks through a single season example.

**`./R/simulate_conditional_data.R`**: This is the script I initially wrote, which the above markdown file is based on. Keeping it here for folks that just want to work through the R script instead.

<div align="center"> <h3>./results/</h3> </div>

---

It contains just one file, which is a summary of the conditional mange model with an autologistic term, fit to the coyote data, and is generated in
`./R/summarisze_conditional_mange_model.R`. The row names of the file are informative (i.e., contain parameter names), while the rest of the columns are the median estimates of a parameter, associated 95% credible interval, and whether or not the 95% credibible interval excludes zero.
